# CV_colors_luminosity
A script to help determine if a CV outburst is likely a dwarf nova or a classical nova

most of the packages required to run this iPython notebook should be included in the standard anaconda distribution. 
The only package that should require additonal installation is the mwdust package. The instructions for installation can be found here: https://github.com/jobovy/mwdust

To run the script, you should not need to edit any of the functions. There is an example of the values you need to enter at the bottom of the script. 

This analysis only works when there is substantial dust along the line of sight A > 5, and the transient can be succesfully cross matched to an object with griz photometry (e.g., Pan-STARRS, SDSS, DeCAPs).
